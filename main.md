# Fazan's Rule:

Helps us determine the percentage of covalent character in compounds using factors like polarizing power and polarizability.

### Polarizing Power: (For Cations)

The ability to attract the anion, causing its electron cloud to deform and get pulled or attracted towards itself.

#### Factors Affecting P.P:

* **Cation's Size:** Smaller = Better
* **Cation's Charge:** Higher = Better

#### Exceptions:

Cations with a pseudo noble gas configuration **[e.g., Cu(+), Ag(+), Au(+), Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Hg(2+)]** have extremely high polarizing power no matter their size.

### Polarizability: (For Anions)

The ability to get pulled or attracted towards a cation, causing deformation in the anion's electron cloud.

#### Factors Affecting Polarizability:

* **Anion's Size:** Bigger = Better
* **Anion's Charge:** Higher = Better
